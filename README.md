This is a personal project for me to learn `react` & `nextjs`. The project is going to be an example website for my friends DJ brand.

**THIS SITE HAS NO AFFILIATION WITH `JDTEK event AB`**

- A webshop with `stripe` checkout
- A simple **landing** & **about** page
- A calendar an list for tour dates
